<p>Sometimes you want to work on a Hyperdrive using files that are outside of Beaker. This is common when you&#39;re using your own source-control, like Git, or when you just want to use an editor outside of Beaker.</p>
<p>In this case, you can use &quot;folder sync.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="setup-new-drive">Setup: new drive</h2>
<p>When you <a href="beginner/creating-new-hyperdrives.md">create a new hyperdrive</a>, you can select a folder to sync by pressing the &quot;From Folder&quot; button. This will cause the drive to be created with the contents of that folder.</p>

<h2 id="setup-existing-drive">Setup: existing drive</h2>
<p>To add folder-sync to an existing drive, click the site-info button and then select &quot;Sync with local folder&quot; under the tools.</p>

<h2 id="syncing-with-the-folder">Syncing with the folder</h2>
<p><img className="centered" src="../../img/folder-sync-button.png" /></p>
<p>Once folder sync is setup, you&#39;ll see an icon on the top right of your URL bar. You can click on that icon to open the folder sync controls.</p>
<p><img className="centered" src="../../img/folder-sync-controls.png" /></p>
<p>The default behavior of folder sync is to manually sync the folder.</p>
<p><img className="centered" src="../../img/folder-sync-restore.png" /></p>
<p>On the right side of files marked for deletion, you&#39;ll find a &quot;restore&quot; button. You can click this to copy the file from the hyperdrive to the local folder.</p>
<p>You can choose to skip files by expanding the &quot;Skip items matching these rules&quot; control. This control is similar to &quot;.gitignore&quot; files and supports using glob stars (&quot;*&quot;). Skipping files is useful for avoiding accidental imports (like your .git or node_modules folders) and for preserving data created by beaker (like the index.json manifest).</p>
<p>When you&#39;re ready to sync the folder, click the big blue &quot;Sync&quot; button.</p>
<h2 id="automatically-syncing">Automatically syncing</h2>
<p>If you want the folder to automatically sync when changes occur, toggle the &quot;Autosync&quot; checkbox. This will sync the folder while respecting your deselected files.</p>
<p>Autosync only stays active as long as Beaker is running, so if you restart Beaker, you&#39;ll need to turn it back on.</p>

<p>Caution! Be careful with autosync! If you&#39;re running a command that will generate folders for the first time like <code>git init</code> or <code>npm install</code> you should turn off autosync so that you can disable sync for the folders they generate.</p>
