<p>The standard behavior of <code>hyper://</code> is to serve whichever file is referenced by the URL. This works fine for simple use-cases, but struggles with two use-cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sites which need a consistent theme and template applied across each page.</li>
<li>Applications which need to serve interfaces even where a file does not exist (as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Application</a> pattern).</li>
</ol>
<p>To solve this, the <code>hyper://</code> protocol supports a behavior called &quot;Frontends.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="how-frontends-work">How frontends work</h2>
<p>A Frontend is simply an html file found at <code>/.ui/ui.html</code>. This file is used to provide a consistent interface for the site. It is served <em>rather</em> <em>than</em> the target file in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>No file exists at the target URL.</li>
<li>The target URL is a folder.</li>
<li>The &quot;Accept&quot; header includes text/html (which indicates the browser is asking for a &quot;page&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the Frontend effectively overrides all page-serving, it can render whatever the site author wants. A common pattern is to use JavaScript to read whatever file is referenced by <code>window.location.pathname</code> and then place that in the UI, as in this example snippet:</p>
<p>title=&quot;/.ui/ui.html&quot;</p>
<p><body>
  <main></main>
</body></p>
<p>
async function setup () {
  var main = document.querySelector(&#39;main&#39;)
  if (location.pathname.endsWith(&#39;.html&#39;)) {
    let html = await beaker.hyperdrive.readFile(location.pathname).catch(e =&gt; <code>&lt;h1&gt;404 not found&lt;h1&gt;</code>)
    main.innerHTML = html
  } else if (location.pathname.endsWith(&#39;.jpg&#39;)) {
    main.innerHTML = <code>&lt;img src=&quot;${location.pathname}&quot;&gt;</code>
  } // etc...
}
setup()

<span class="hljs-comment">## Mounted frontends</span>

An advantage <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> Frontends <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> they are stored <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a subfolder. This makes <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> possible <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> frontends <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> be their own Hyperdrive sites which are mounted <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> `/.ui`.

|<span class="hljs-number">12345.</span>.af&gt; mount $my_frontend_drive_url /.ui
</code></pre><p>Frontend hyperdrives can then be published and shared across multiple sites.</p>
