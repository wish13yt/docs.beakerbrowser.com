title: Creating Mounts
---

"Mounting" is a tool which links one hyperdrive to another as a subfolder.

Mounts are useful for a variety of use-cases. They can be used to make collections, to attach code-module dependencies, and more.

A mounted drive will behave just like a subfolder. If you don't "own" the mounted drive, it will be read-only, even if the containing drive is yours.

## In the editor

Visit your hyperdrive and [open the editor](beginner/using-the-editor.md). Then expand the files listing by clicking on the folder icon.

<img className="centered" src="/img/editor-list-files.png" />

Right-click in the files listing (but not on a file) and select "New Mount."

<img className="centered" src="/img/editor-new-mount.png" />

You will be prompted to select a hyperdrive to mount. If your target drive is not in the listing, enter the drive's URL in the input.

<img className="centered" src="/img/select-drive-dialog.png" />

You'll then be prompted to enter the mount's name. This is the name of the "folder" which the mount will represent. Choose a name and press "OK."

<img className="centered" src="/img/mount-name-dialog.png" />

Your new mount will appear in the editor's files listing.

## In the files explorer

Visit your hyperdrive and open the files explorer by clicking "Explore Files."

<img className="centered" src="/img/open-files-explorer.png" />

Right-click in the files listing (but not on a file) and select "New Mount."

<img className="centered" src="/img/files-explorer-new-mount.png" />

You will be prompted to select a hyperdrive to mount. If your target drive is not in the listing, enter the drive's URL in the input.

<img className="centered" src="/img/select-drive-dialog.png" />

You'll then be prompted to enter the mount's name. This is the name of the "folder" which the mount will represent. Choose a name and press "OK."

<img className="centered" src="/img/mount-name-dialog.png" />

Your new mount will appear in the explorer's files listing.
