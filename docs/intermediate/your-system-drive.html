<p>Beaker automatically creates a private &quot;System Drive&quot; for storing your private information. It contains your saved hyperdrives, bookmarks, and more.</p>
<p>You can find the drive by opening the browser menu and selecting &quot;My Private Drive.&quot;</p>
<p><img className="centered" src="../img/browser-menu-system-drive.png" /></p>
<p>Beaker assigns your system drive the <code>hyper://private/</code> domain name. You cannot share content using the system drive, as each user has their own <code>hyper://private/</code> address. (This is a good thing because your system drive contains private information!)</p>
