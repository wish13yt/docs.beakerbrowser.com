<p><strong>If your network is &quot;not hole-punchable,&quot; you may have trouble connecting to other peers.</strong> This may be due to your network configuration.</p>
<p>Beaker&#39;s peer-to-peer networking relies on &quot;hole-punching,&quot; a technique which makes your device accessible to people outside of your local network.</p>
<p>In some cases, hole-punching may fail. This will be indicated by Beaker in the top right:</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean that <strong>all</strong> connections will fail, but it does mean that the odds of failed connection are higher.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-happen-and-what-can-i-do-">Why does this happen and what can I do?</h2>
<p>Some network routers and VPNs do not support hole-punching. If you&#39;re using a VPN, try disabling it. You may also need to try other networks.</p>
<p>We&#39;re working on ways to ensure connectivity even if hole-punching fails. Sorry if this is an ongoing problem for you!</p>
