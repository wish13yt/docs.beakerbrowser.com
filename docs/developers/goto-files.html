<p>A .goto file is a shortcut file used by Beaker in many different contexts. All bookmarks, for instance, are saved as .goto files in the user&#39;s system drive.</p>
<p>A .goto file is not expected to have any content. Instead, it has two <a href="introduction-to-hyperdrive.md#file-kv-metadata">metadata attributes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>title</code></strong>. The title of the resource being pointed to by the .goto file.</li>
<li><strong><code>href</code></strong>. The URL of the resource being pointed to by the .goto file.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a .goto file is visited on the <code>hyper://</code> protocol, Beaker will automatically redirect to its <code>href</code> value.</p>
<p>You can create .goto files using <a href="advanced/webterm.md">Webterm</a> with the <strong>mkgoto</strong> command.</p>
