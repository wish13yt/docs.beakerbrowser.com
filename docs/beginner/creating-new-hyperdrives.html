title: Creating New Hyperdrives
---

You can create as many hyperdrives as you want. Each hyperdrive has its own URL. You [share the URL](sharing-hyperdrives.md) so that other people can visit the hyperdrive.

Only the creator of a hyperdrive can change its files. Visitors can only view the drive (though they can [fork the hyperdrive](advanced/forking-hyperdrives.md) to make their own copy).

To create a new hyperdrive, click on the hamburger menu on the top right of the browser.

<img className="centered" src="/img/open-browser-menu.png" />

Then select "New Hyperdrive..."

<img className="centered" src="/img/new-hyperdrive.png" />

You will be prompted to input a title and, optionally, a description and some tags. These will be used to identify the hyperdrive. (The tags are private, but the title and description are public.)

<img className="centered" src="/img/new-hyperdrive-prompt.png" />

You will be taken to the new hyperdrive which is (mostly) empty.

<img src="/img/fresh-hyperdrive.png" />

Your hyperdrive is now ready to edit. You can create a new `index.md` (for Markdown) or `index.html` (for HTML) by clicking on the prompts below.

Next, [use the editor](using-the-editor.md) to develop the hyperdrive.
