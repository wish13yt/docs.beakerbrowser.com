title: Hosting Hyperdrives
---

You can help keep other people's hyperdrives online by contributing bandwidth. This is called "hosting."

To host a drive, visit the drive and click on the peer count on the right side of the address bar. You will see a toggle. Switch it to the green "on" state.

You can turn off hosting by toggling the button again.
