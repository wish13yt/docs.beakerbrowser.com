<h1>Welcome!</h1> 
<h2>Beaker is a peer-to-peer browser for web hackers.</h2>
<p>It includes a bunch of tools:</p>
<h3>&#x2022; Instant website creatio</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; A builtin editor</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; A terminal enviornment</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; Peer-to-peer web APIs</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; and more.</h3>
<p>In this guide, we're going to familiarize you with Beaker's ideas and tools.</p>

<h2>What is this peer-to-peer thing?</h2>

<p>Beaker uses a peer-to-peer protocol called Hypercore (now known as Pear), or Hyper for short. "Hyperdrives" are like websites. They store webpages, pictures, media, user data, and so on. Hyperdrives power a lot of Beaker's best features.</p>

<p><strong>"Hyperdrives" are folders you host from your computer.</strong> They contain web pages which you can browse and edit. You can create and share hyperdrives using Beaker.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer means that you host data directly from your device.</p>

<p>One fun attribute of peer-to-peer is "co-hosting." This is where you help keep a hyperdrive online by storing the data and contributing bandwidth to other users. It happens temporarily when you visit a hyperdrive, but you can turn it on permanently for sites you like.</p>

<p><strong>You can "host" other people's hyperdrives</strong> to help keep them online and contribute bandwidth.</p>
